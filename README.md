# Machine Learning Project: E-commerce Purchase Classification

* This project was conducted as a final project for the course "Machine Learning" during my B.Sc. degree.
* The project utilized user session data from an e-commerce site to predict whether a user would make a purchase.
* Includes thorough pre-processing and testing of various models.
* Ultimately, we utilized a Neural Network Model.
* Our final model achieved an AUC score of 0.93 on the validation set.

## Important Note

The project achieved an AUC score of 0.91 on the test set, but we do not have the labels for this set. Only the course instructor had them, so it could be a proper "test set" to judge our work.

## Project Files

1. Jupyter notebook file that uses Python.
2. Concise PDF report in Hebrew.
3. The labeled "train" dataset.
4. The unlabeled "test" dataset.
